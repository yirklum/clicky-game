"King of the Click" is a memory game that incorporates the characters from the animated television show King of the Hill. The player must click on the character cards displayed on the screen. To win, they must click on each card once without clicking on any card twice. Once they pick every character -- achieving a score of 15 -- they win the game. However, if they click on the same card twice, they lose the game.

This app was built using React and its associated technologies. It also utilizes Javascript (ES6) and CSS.

For future development, this app can be expanded to include more cards and different sets of cards that the player can choose from.
